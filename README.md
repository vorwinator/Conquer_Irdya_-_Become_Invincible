# 🎮 Battle for Wesnoth - Conquer Irdya - Become Invincible 

This is addon in progress.\
It's heavily inspired by LoTI - Legend of The Invincibles.\
It's a campaign about Sauron that lands in this world without any idea how.
Time of the campaign is placed after events that happend in LoTI addon.

**Plan is to make:**
- around 10-15 scenarios on green isle
- few scenarios about journey to the Great Continent
- around 50 or more scenarios in The Great Continent
- scenarios filled with story telling to the end of common sense

I'm doing this campaign in order to learn WML - Wesnoth Markup Language and to extend fun that I had during LoTI campaign.
So I think it might be interesting campaign when I will put everything I learn into this long campaign.

That's all :D
